      <lh><strong>Chapter 8 - Forms</strong></lh>
      <li>What are WAI-ARIA labels?</li>
      <li>-answer- WAI-ARIA stands for Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications and it allows developers can make advanced Web applications accessible and usable to people with disabilities. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/">w3.org</a>and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA">developer.mozilla.org</a></li>
      <li>Not many note on Forms because I feel pretty comfortable and fairly familiar with them. Did play around with the examples though.</li>
      <br>
      <lh><strong>Chapter 12 - Object-Oriented Programming in JS</strong></lh>
      <li>Three main concepts: <b>Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance</b></li>
      <li><b>Encapsulation:</b> is keeping the inner workings hidden by putting all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality.</li>
      <li><b>Polymorphism:</b> is the ability to use the same process can be used by different objects. With various objects being able to sharing the same method, but also letting them have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation when needed.</li>
      <li><b>Inheritance:</b> is being able to take features form one object and then adding more properties and/or methods to it to make a new object.</li>
      <li>The class declaration syntax works in exactly the same way as the constructor function syntax, because it’s actually just syntactic sugar that is implemented in the same way in the background.</li>
      <li>The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the class has been declared. It should be used to define any properties that will remain the same for every instance of the class.</li>
      <br>
      <lh><strong>Chapter 15 - Modern JavaScript</strong></lh>
      <li>One of jQuery's bid advantages is that is provides support to old browsers.</li>
      <li>Lodash also has a modular architecture that allows you to selectively use only the functions that you require in your projects, rather than having to include the whole library.</li>
      <li>Standard import looks like <b>import { PI } from './pi.js';</b> and comes form a JS file that has an export like this <b>export {exampleFunctionName,orObjectName}</b></li>
      <li>default imports look like this <b>import PI form './example.js';</b> and the export file should have this at the bottom <b>export default example</b></li>
      <li>Only one default export can be used per js file, more will cause a syntax error</li>
      <li>Model-View-Controller (MVC) separates an application into three distinct, independent components that interact with each other</li>
      <li>Models are objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading, updating and deleting (known as CRUD tasks) specific pieces of information about the application,</li>
      <li>Views provide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant information. In a web application, this would be the HTML displayed on a web page.</li>
      <li>Controllers link models and views together by communicating between them. They respond to events, which are usually inputs from a user, process the information, and then update the model and view accordingly.</li>
      <li>React and Vue.js both use the concept of a virtual DOM to speed up the process of updating HTML pages</li>
      <li>As a general rule, you should aim to use well-commented and descriptive code in development and minified code in production (since there’s no need for end users to read comments).</li>
   </ul>
