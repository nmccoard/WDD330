   <ul>
      <lh><strong>Novice to Ninja Chapter 2</strong></lh>
      <li>Variables declared using const and let will have local scope and only available in the block they where created in. Var or not using keyword will have a global scope (very problematic) so avoid using them.</li>
      <li>When naming constants and variables, you should try to give them sensible names that describe what the variable represents</li>
      <li>Probably the best convention for naming variables and functions if to use camel-case. This follows the same notation used with JS's built in functions.</li>
      <li>Assigning primitive type values to a variable is done directly.</li>
      <li>Non-primitive types (objects) assignments are done by reference. So any changes to the variable will change the object every where and not limited by scope.</li>
      <li>,indexOf() will return a -1 if the character does not exist in a string (I did not know this).</li>
      <li>Remember .startsWith() and .endsWith() are case sensitive.</li>
      <li>I don't get what the use case is for symbol?</li>
      <li>In general, values tend to be set to undefined by JavaScript, whereas values are usually set to null manually by the programmer.</li>
      <li>Remember when checking if strings are < or > upper-case letters are considered to be "less than" lower-case letters and is done in alphabetic order.</or></li>
      <br>
      <lh><strong>Chapter 3 - Arrays, Logic, and Loops</strong></lh>
      <li>Deleting something from an array will not reduce the length of the arry, because the removed value will be replaced with undefined and not removed.</li>
      <li>To remove something from the array we could use pop to remove it off the end or the array or we could use shift to take it off the front. But if we need to remove something from the middle we would need to us splice (like this avengers.splice(1, 1) the first number is the position in the array and the second number is the number of thing to be removed. Splice and also be used to add things in the middle of an array by using a third argument for the value to be added.</li>
      <li>I need to work on using more Ternary Operators in place of simple if / else statements. [condition <strong>?</strong> run this if true <strong>:</strong> else do this;] </li>
      <li>When looping over arrays it better to do this <strong>for(let i=0, max=avengers.length; i < max; i++)</strong> over this <strong>for(let i=0;  i< avengers.length; i++)</strong> </li>
      <li>Use for of loops to simplify looping over arrays [<strong>for</strong>(const varName <strong>of</strong> array)]</li>
      <li>Why does the variable in the for of loop need to be declared using const?</li>
      <br>
      <lh><strong>Chapter 4 - Functions</strong></lh>
      <li>Default parameters should always come after non-default parameters.If not then you will need to enter the default value any way. Remember position matters, the first argument will always go to the first parameter.</li>
